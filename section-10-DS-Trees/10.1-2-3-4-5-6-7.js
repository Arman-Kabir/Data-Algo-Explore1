// 10.1
// Trees -- are a data structure that have what we call a hierarchical structure as oppossed
// to something like linked lists or arrays which are linear.
//*  Linked list is technically a type of tree but with just one single path and
//  it's linear there'e only one  way to go from top to bottom.


// 10.2 Binary Trees
// *Each node can have either 0, 1, or 2 nodes and each child can only have one parent
// perfect binary tree
// full binary tree


// 10.3
// function BinaryTreeNode(value) {
//     this.value = value;
//     this.left = null;
//     this.right = null;
// }



// 10.5 - Binary Search Tree
/* 
*All child nodes in the tree to the right of the root node must be greater
  than the current node.
* A node can only have up to 2 children.cz it's a binary tree.
