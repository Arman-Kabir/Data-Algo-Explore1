// Hash tables are implemented differently in different languages but most of the time ----
// the key and the value can be any type of Data Structure .
// We can have a function as a value, another object, an array as well. We can have arrays of objects

// In Js in an object --- if u pass a key that is a number or a function it actually
// gets a string. It only allows string keys.

/*
But New version of Js and Es6, we have something called Map and Sets.
